# jasperreportswithspringboot
A demo for using jasper within a Spring Boot App I made for a Jasper session.

This depicts integration of jasper reports within a spring boot app .

Mostly uses concept of JasperReportsViewResolver as defined here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27532446/how-to-use-jasperreports-with-spring-mvc 
[Check the answer with the tick there :)]

Also the report included using my custom db and data so try putting your own .jrxml report there before trying to run.

`The jasper endpoints shall be like http://localhost:8080/report/{reportname}?format={format}&id={id} (id param are optional,you can add ur custom report params there)`


Cheers!
